# 2D Capacitance Solver

## Overview

The 2D Capacitance Solver is an open-source project designed to solve 2D capacitance problems using a custom mathematical engine. It includes a backend for performing calculations and a frontend for user interaction, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This tool is ideal for educational and research purposes in the field of electrical engineering and physics.

## Features

- **Backend**: 
  - Solves 2D capacitance problems using a custom mathematical engine.
  - Supports non-uniform grid generation.
  - Provides detailed logging for debugging and performance analysis.
  - Capable of visualizing electric fields and potential distributions.

- **Frontend**:
  - User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
  - Visualizes results with plots and diagrams.
  - Allows users to input parameters and view results dynamically.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andykofman/2D-FieldSolver-for-Solving-ParasiticCapacitance
   cd 2d-capacitance-solver
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:
bash
python main.py




### Backend

The backend is responsible for all calculations and performance optimizations. It includes:

- **Coordinate System**: Manages grid points and physical dimensions.
- **Laplace Solver**: Solves the Laplace equation for potential distribution.
- **Capacitance Extraction**: Computes the capacitance matrix and charges.
- **Nonuniform Grid**: Generates non-uniform grids for enhanced accuracy.

### Frontend

The frontend provides a GUI for user interaction. It allows users to:

- Input physical dimensions and material properties.
- Define conductor geometries.
- Visualize potential distributions and electric fields.
- Export results for further analysis.
